# Grid Environmental Data Services

This [repository](https://github.com/skofic/environmental-services.git) contains the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) [Foxx micro service](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/foxx.html) for publishing *remote sensing* and *climate data* related published in the [EUFGIS](http://www.eufgis.org) information system.

This set of services concentrates on data stored in layers of geographic grids in different resolutions, while another set of services concentrate on data characterising the geographic boundaries of conservation units.

This work is being conducted for the [upgrade](https://www.forgenius.eu/eufgis) of the [EUFGIS](http://www.eufgis.org/) information system within the framework of the [FORGENIUS](https://www.forgenius.eu/) project.

## Database

The database is implemented using [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/). The data is not included in this repository, you will have to run a series of scripts to download, clip, process, combine and merge [Chelsa](https://chelsa-climate.org/), [WorldClim](https://worldclim.org/) and [EDO](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) data, all this is available in [this](https://github.com/skofic/ClimateService.git) repository.

The database contains the following collections:

### Chelsa

[CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org) [version 2.1](https://chelsa-climate.org/wp-admin/download-page/CHELSA_tech_specification_V2.pdf) is based on a mechanistical statistical downscaling of global reanalysis data or global circulation model output, it is a [model](https://chelsa-climate.org/wp-admin/download-page/CHELSA_tech_specification_V2.pdf) that aims at representing reality as precise as possible. It provides high spatial resolution (30 arc seconds) grid of global weather and climate data for historical data, *1981-2010*, and future modelled climate scenarios.

Future climate scenarios come from the [Max Plank Institute Earth System Model](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/research/department-climate-variability/earth-system-modeling-and-prediction) version [MPI-ESM1-2-HR](https://www.wdc-climate.de/ui/cmip6?input=CMIP6.HighResMIP.MPI-M.MPI-ESM1-2-HR), a [climate model](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/) developed as part of the internationally-coordinated Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ([CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/)). The values were averages over 3 20 year periods: *2011-2040*, *2041-2070* and *2071-2100*. 

*Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)* are climate change scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100 as defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on climate change in 2021. Of these the [Shared Socioeconomic Pathway](https://climatedata.ca/resource/understanding-shared-socio-economic-pathways-ssps/) [SSP3-RCP7](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/available-parameters/climate-data/#scenario3) was selected: *regional rivalry* (a rocky road):

> The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.

#### Data

The collection contains over 36 million data records, *one* for *each grid cell*. This data source is usually interrogated providing a *point* and *selecting* the *grid cell* that *contains it*. There are also services that allow *selecting* a *set of grid cells* based on *distance range*, that are *contained* or that *intersect* with a provided *reference geometry*: the *results* can be *listed* or *aggregated* using a set of *statistical methods*.

The records are structured as follows:

```json
{
  "_key": "e017884385d8e18e97067453578f8bc3",
  "std_dataset_ids": [
    "4badf85d-270a-463c-89d3-04bc52d806bd"
  ],
  "geometry_point": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
       /* data */
    ]
  },
  "geometry_bounds": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      /* data */
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "1981-2010": {
      /* data */
      "std_date_span_month": [
        /* data */
      ]
    },
    "2011-2040": {
      "MPI-ESM1-2-HR": {
        "ssp370": {
          /* data */
          "std_date_span_month": [
            /* data */
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "2041-2070": {
      "MPI-ESM1-2-HR": {
        "ssp370": {
          /* data */
          "std_date_span_month": [
            /* data */
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "2071-2100": {
      "MPI-ESM1-2-HR": {
        "ssp370": {
          /* data */
          "std_date_span_month": [
            /* data */
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `_key` represents the *primary key* of the record, it is the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the `geometry_bounds` field.

The `std_dataset_ids` field contains the *list* of *all datasets* featured *in the record*; the values are *references* to the corresponding `Dataset` records.

The `geometry_point` contains the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) *point coordinates* of the *center* of the *grid cell*.

The `geometry_bounds` contains the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) *polygon coordinates* of the *grid cell*.

The `properties` field contains all the *data*, it is subdivided into the *four time periods*:

- `1981-2010`: *Historical data* averaged for the period ranging from 1981 to 2010. At the top level we find yearly period averages and the `std_date_span_month` field contains monthly data averages for the same period.
- `2011-2040`: *Modelled data* for the period ranging from 2011 to 2040. The `MPI-ESM1-2-HR` and `ssp370` fields indicate respectively the [climate model](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/research/department-climate-variability/earth-system-modeling-and-prediction) and the [shared socioeconomic pathway](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/available-parameters/climate-data/#scenario3) used in the modelling. At the top level of the `ssp370` property we find yearly period averages and the `std_date_span_month` field contains monthly data averages for the same period.
- `2041-2070`: *Modelled data* for the period ranging from 2041 to 2070. The structure of the data is the same as the *previously described section*.
- `2071-2100`: *Modelled data* for the period ranging from 2071 to 2100. The structure of the data is the same as the *previously described section*.

All *data variables* are *documented* in the [data dictionary](https://github.com/skofic/data-dictionary-service.git).

#### Indexes

Both the `geometry_point` and the `geometry_bounds` fields are indexed with type `geo`. The point geometry is used to select by distance, while the polygon geometry is used for all other geometry searches.

### WorldClim

[WorldClim](https://worldclim.org) version 2.1 is a database of high spatial resolution (30 arc seconds) global weather and climate data, it provides historical data, 1970-2000, and future modelled climate scenarios ranging from 2021 to 2100.

Future climate scenarios come from the [Max Plank Institute Earth System Model](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/research/department-climate-variability/earth-system-modeling-and-prediction) version [MPI-ESM1-2-HR](https://www.wdc-climate.de/ui/cmip6?input=CMIP6.HighResMIP.MPI-M.MPI-ESM1-2-HR), a [climate model](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained/) developed as part of the internationally-coordinated Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ([CMIP6](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/)). The monthly values were averages over 4 20 year periods, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080 and 2081-2100. 

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are climate change scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100 as defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on climate change in 2021. Of these the [Shared Socioeconomic Pathway](https://climatedata.ca/resource/understanding-shared-socio-economic-pathways-ssps/) [SSP3-RCP7](https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/available-parameters/climate-data/#scenario3) was selected: *regional rivalry* (a rocky road):

Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.

#### Data

The collection contains over 21 million data records, one for each grid cell. This data source is usually interrogated providing a *point* and *selecting* the *grid cell that contains it*. There are also services that provide a *selection of grid cells* within a specific *distance range*, *contained by* or *intersecting* a provided *geometric shape*, the results can *also be aggregated*.

### DroughtObservatory

This collection currently contains over 1.2 billion records from the [European Drought Observatory](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) repository. It is a collection of measurements subdivided into a set of 1km., 5km. and 25 km. resolution grids covering the European region. Each record references a *specific layer cell* and *date*, all dates are daily.

#### Data

The records are grouped by *geometry* and *date*, and have the following structure:

```json
{
    "geometry_hash": "7e142bf917dbf13cd8c106142cabc9f9",

      "6b12011e-ef30-47d4-b4a3-3c8bdc4b4464"
    ]
}
```

The `geometry_hash` references the record in the `DroughtObservatoryMap` collection that represents the *grid cell*, it is the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) *polygon* representing the *grid cell* that is the `geometry` property in the `DroughtObservatoryMap` collection.

The `std_date` field represents the measurement *date* in `YYYYMMDD` format, `Y` for year, `M` for month and `D` for day. All dates have a *daily span*.

#### Index

The collection features a *unique* index on the `geometry_hash` and `std_date` fields.

### DroughtObservatoryMap

This collection contains one record for each grid cell from the [European Drought Observatory](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) repository, it contains almost 1.5 million records. It is used to record the geometry of the grid cells and to link`DroughtObservatory` collection time series.

#### Data

Records follow this structure:

```json
{
  "_key": "2b79886df88dbac9822a7a1a00426fc2",

    "coordinates": [ /* data */ ]
  },
  "geometry_point": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [ /* data */ ]
  },
  "geometry_point_radius": 0.020833335
}

All properties are documented in the [data dictionary](https://github.com/skofic/data-dictionary-service.git).

#### Index

The collection features a single Geo index on the `geometry` property.

### Dataset

This collection contains one record for each *dataset* featured in the database. A dataset represents a *set of indicators* belonging to the *same repository*, they must have the same *grid resolution* and share the same *time series resolution*. You have seen references to elements of this collection in almost all collections of the database.

#### Data

```

## Installation

1. You must first either install [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com), or have an existing database available.
2. *Create* or *select* an existing *database*.
3. In the `Services` *left tab* press the `+ Add service` button.
4. Select the `GitHub` *top tab*, set the `Repository` field to **skofic/env-grid-data-services** and the `Version` field to **main**; press the `Install` button.
5. An alert will be presented requesting the `Mount point` for the service, you can provide *any suitable value*, ensure the `Run setup?` checkbox is *checked*. Press the `Install` button.

At this point the service will do the following actions:

1. It will create the necessary *collections*, if not already there:
    - The *Chelsa* collection that will hold all Chelsa data.
    - The *WorldClim* collection that will hold all WorldClim data.
    - The *DroughtObservatory*  collection to store EDO data.
    - The *DroughtObservatoryMap* collection to store the EDO grid.
    - The *Dataset* collection to store all datasets metadata.
2. It will create the necessary *views*, if not already there:
    - The *VIEW_DATASET* view to manage datasets metadata.

You will see that in the `Services` *left tab* there is a *top tab* called `Settings`: this can be used to *customise* the collection and view names.

## Services

Once the services are installed you will have an empty configured database and microservices to query the data.

To fill the data refer to this [repository](https://github.com/skofic/ClimateService.git). *Note that loading the database with data is a **VERY LONG** process and requires **A LOT** of **RESOURCES***.

The directory containing the services has the following elements:

- **`api`**: This directory contains a set of microservices definition documents, of which `GeoService API Document.paw`, a [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) document, is the original. The directory contains also a [Postman](https://www.postman.com) version. The files contain example service calls.
- **`images`**: Images used in this README.md file.
- **`notes`**: Miscellaneous notes and files.

*All other files and directories* represent the source files, please refer to the [Foxx microservices documentation](https://docs.arangodb.com/stable/develop/foxx-microservices/) for more information. *Note that if you use the ArangoDB default user interface, all services are documented*.

The microservices are divided into the following sections:

### Chelsa

This section contains the services used to query and aggregate [Chelsa](https://chelsa-climate.org) data. Each record represents a 30 seconds arc grid cell containing historic and future modelled data covering yearly and monthly statistics.

Records are stored in the `Chelsa` collection and structured as follows:

- **`geometry_hash`**: This is the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash of the `geometry_bounds` property, it represents the *primary key* of the record.
- **`geometry_point`**: This is the [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) *point* corresponding to the *center* of the *grid cell*.

### Remote Sensing Metadata

Remote sensing data is associated to *conservation unit geometries*, the data is *averaged* for each geometry characterising the regions that make up a conservation unit. The purpose of these services is to provide *aggregated summary information* before performing queries on the actual data.

The reason these services are important is that there is a very large amount of data associated with each geometry, it is therefore a good practice to retrieve a window of data selected using a user interface that limits which descriptors are returned and for which time frame.

Data is stored in two main collections: `UnitPolygons` and `Shapes`. `UnitPolygons` contains the aggregated shape for each conservation unit, while the `Shapes` collection contains the individual polygons comprising all conservation units.

The main grouping in this set of services is *time span*, which indicates whether the date is a *year*, *month* or *day*.

All services select remote sensing data according to a set of query parameters provided in the body, omit any to ignore:

- ***`geometry_hash_list`***: List of conservation unit geometries to match. This parameter is only available in services handling shapes (`Shapes`).
- ***`gcu_id_number_list`***: List of conservation unit numbers to match. This parameter is only available in services handling unit shapes (`UnitPolygons`).
- ***`std_date_span`***: List of time spans to match: daily data, `std_date_span_day`, monthly data, `std_date_span_month` and/or yearly data, `std_date_span_year`.

- ***`std_date_end`***: End date (included).
- ***`std_terms`***: List of variables to match.
- ***`std_dataset_ids`***: List of datasets to match.

Note that all dates are expressed in `YYYYMMDD` string format, where the day, `DD`, and month, `MM`, can be omitted: this means that dates remain sorted and it is not necessary to have separate query fields for daily, monthly and yearly data.

#### Shape metadata by time span - `/rs/meta/span/shape`

This service will return the *data summary* of *remote sensing data* matching the query parameters provided in the body. The data will be *grouped* by *time span*, `std_date_span`, and the *summary data* will *aggregate* all *matched geometries* in the *matched time spans*.

The result will be a series of records grouped by *time span*, `std_date_span`, and  structured as follows:

- ***`count`***: Number of records matched for the current time span.

### European Drought Observatory Metadata

[European Drought Observatory](https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/php/index.php?id=1000) data is provided in a grid, the idea is that users can provide a point or shape and get in real time a set of data. The purpose of these services is to provide *aggregated information* before performing queries on the actual data.

The reason these services are important is that there is a very large amount of data associated with each point of the grid, it is therefore a good practice to retrieve a window of data selected using a user interface that limits which descriptors are returned and for which data time frame.

Data is stored in two related collections: `DroughtObservatory` groups data by grid cell geometry and date, all dates are daily; `DroughtObservatoryMap` contains the geometry of all grid cells. Services are designed to first probe the grid and then associate data related to the selected cells.

The grid features cells of three different resolutions, so whenever you select a point on the map you should have at least three grid cells that contain that point, the services will either return the *summary data* grouped by *date*, or by *date* and *grid cell resolution*.
